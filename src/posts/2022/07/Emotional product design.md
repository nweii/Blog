[Spotify’s Embodiment of Emotional Design - raw.studio](https://raw.studio/blog/spotify-embodiment-emotional-design/):
> Don Norman, often credited as the father of UX, coined the term ‘Emotional Design’ in his book, Emotional Design: Why We Love (or Hate) Everyday Things in 2003. At almost twenty years later, the concepts still remain relevant. Norman believes that good emotional design works on three levels: visceral, behavioural and reflective.
> “Everything has a personality: everything sends an emotional signal. Even where this was not the intention of the designer, the people who view the website infer personalities and experience emotions.”
> _“Users often perceive aesthetically pleasing design as design that’s more usable. An aesthetically pleasing design creates a positive response in people’s brains and leads them to believe the design actually works better.”_
> This design approach stems from iterations of [design principles](https://spotify.design/article/introducing-spotifys-new-design-principles) over the years. According to Spotify, the designers found it hard to focus on so many principles, and found that as the product grew, some of the values became less pertinent.
> They moved from six principles to three core areas of focus:
> - **Relevant** – _It’s about reflecting you as an individual._
> - **Human** – _It’s about communication, expression, and human connection._
> - **Unified** – _It’s about how our brand manifests across our features and apps._
> Visual comfort leads to more browsing, so the simplistic and aesthetic nature of their app makes us as users feel more inclined to use it as it doesn’t appear intimidating.
> In 2021’s Wrapped, the colours were bold, bright and unapologetic. There was even a section titled “Your Audio Aura,” a gradient, fluid combination of colours meant to correspond to the melodic vibe of your most-listened-to music – trying to make Spotify’s listeners feel appreciated and understood through their music taste.
> Something that is inherently human is wanting to feel in some way special, valued or listened to. We tend to spend more time and effort with people that we know and love. In the same way, we use apps more frequently when we feel that little more connected, a little more valued and a little more human.

I like how this focuses on the aspect of design that appeals to how users feel. Data/research are obviously a key factor in the process, but I appreciate that the article gives so much weight to polish and delight.
