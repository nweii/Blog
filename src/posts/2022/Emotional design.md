Don Norman, often credited as the father of UX, coined the term ‘Emotional Design’ in his book, Emotional Design: Why We Love (or Hate) Everyday Things in 2003. At almost twenty years later, the concepts still remain relevant. Norman believes that good emotional design works on three levels: visceral, behavioural and reflective.  
<em>“Everything has a personality: everything sends an emotional signal. Even where this was not the intention of the designer, the people who view the website infer personalities and experience emotions.”</em><br>
Visceral design concerns itself with appearance – it is the user’s initial reaction or first impression to a design. This practise reflects the Aesthetic Usability Effect well, one of the 7 Laws of UX, which states:  <br>
<em>“Users often perceive aesthetically pleasing design as design that’s more usable. An aesthetically pleasing design creates a positive response in people’s brains and leads them to believe the design actually works better.”</em><br>

I like how this focuses on the aspect of design that appeals to how users feel. Data/research are obviously a key factor in the process, but I appreciate that the article gives so much weight to polish and delight.
