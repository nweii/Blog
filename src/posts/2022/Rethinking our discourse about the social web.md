This [E-flux essay on social media ideology](https://www.e-flux.com/journal/75/67166/on-the-social-media-ideology/) makes a few expansive arguments about what we consider when we think about the social web:

<p>Social networking is much more than just a dominant discourse. We need to go beyond text and images and include its software, interfaces, and networks that depend on a technical infrastructure consisting of offices and their consultants and cleaners, cables and data centers, working in close concert with the movements and habits of the connected billions.

We often overlook the physicality of the internet. The ethereal "cloud" is actually a [massive network of data centers](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/01/amazon-web-services-data-center/423147/) in server array rooms [so massive](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=internet+server+rooms&iar=images&iax=images&ia=images) and imposing that they remind me of [terra cotta armies](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=terra+cotta+armies&iax=images&ia=images). In general, we should think more holistically about the systems we use, especially foundational ones we typically take for granted.

<p>… Before we enter the social media sphere, everyone first fills out a profile and choses a username and password in order to create an account. Minutes later, you’re part of the game and you start sharing, creating, playing, as if it has always been like that [...] The platforms present themselves as self-evident. <strong>They just are</strong>—facilitating our feature-rich lives.</p>

It's easy to overlook the role that experimentation, design, and *happenstance* have played in the processes we take for granted today. Before movies matured into a standard media format, every movie was an "experimental" movie. Today, we can assume a film will have a main character(s), conflict, plot, rising action, and climax. But things didn't have to turn out this way, and they don't have to remain this way.[^1]
Viewing social media as something that developed incidentally enables a lot of conceptual offshoots. It's at a point where it's optimized for capitalism (profit over wellbeing), hyper-individuality, and neglect:

<p>Treating social media as ideology means observing how it binds together media, culture, and identity into an ever-growing cultural performance (and related “cultural studies”) of gender, lifestyle, fashion, brands, celebrity, and news from radio, television, magazines, and the web—all of this imbricated with the entrepreneurial values of venture capital and start-up culture, with their underside of declining livelihoods and growing inequality.</p>

And extending that holistic view to all software helps the argument that software is a form of ideology:

<p>Software “fulfills almost every formal definition of ideology we have, from ideology as false consciousness to Louis Althusser’s definition of ideology as a ‘representation’ of the imaginary relation of individuals to their real conditions of existence.’”<br />
Software, or perhaps more precisely operating systems, offer us an <strong>imaginary relationship to our hardware</strong>: they do not represent transistors but rather desktops and recycling bins. <strong>Software produces users.</strong> Without operating system (OS) there would be no access to hardware; <strong>without OS no actions, no practices</strong>, and thus no user. Each OS, through its advertisements, interpellates a “user”: calls it and offers it a name or image with which to identify.</p>

We could say that social media performs the same function, assigning a value to engagement and actions that's actually optimized for advertisers & companies, laying down templates for us to express ourselves, and making visibility into something that's less about existing and more about self-branding.

[^1]: Today's arthouse films could have been another universe's overcommercialized Marvel movies. I wonder how today's standards could be seen as rudimentary/experimental/quaint by those in the future.  
	At the time of its release in 1929, critics dismissed *Man with a Movie Camera* (1929), an avant-garde documentary with no actors or "plot," even when it popularized now-common film techniques fast & slow motion, jump cuts, split screens, and match cuts. Now, elements like its quick cuts and self-referentiality common in contemporary films/series.
